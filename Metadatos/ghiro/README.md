Sometime forensic investigators need to process digital images as evidence.
There are some tools around, otherwise it is difficult to deal with forensic
analysis with lot of images involved.
Images contain tons of information, Ghiro extracts these information from
provided images and display them in a nicely formatted report.
Dealing with tons of images is pretty easy, Ghiro is designed to scale to
support gigs of images.
All tasks are totally automated, you have just to upload you images and let
Ghiro does the work.
Understandable reports, and great search capabilities allows you to find a
needle in a haystack.
Ghiro is a multi user environment, different permissions can be assigned to each
user.
Cases allow you to group image analysis by topic, you can choose which user
allow to see your case with a permission schema.
